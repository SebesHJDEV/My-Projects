# Data-Analysis-Projects-With-Pandas

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Projects with Pandas** repository! This repository tracks my learning progress and hands-on projects in data analysis using Python and the Pandas library.

## Why I’m Learning Python

I’m learning Python because of its simplicity, versatility, and wide use in data science. Python, combined with Pandas, provides powerful tools to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data efficiently. My goal is to strengthen my data analysis skills to solve complex data problems and contribute to data-driven projects in the future.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing different data analysis techniques using Pandas.
- **Data/**: Sample datasets used for analysis.
- **Scripts/**: Python scripts used in various projects.

## Projects Included

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Learning how to clean, filter, and visualize data using Pandas.
2. **Data Transformation**: Applying functions to reshape and manipulate datasets.
3. **Real-World Data Projects**: Tackling practical data problems with real-world datasets.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for these projects.
- **Pandas**: The core library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: To write and run the data analysis code interactively.
